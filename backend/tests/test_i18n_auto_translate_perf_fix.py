"""
Test suite for i18n auto-translate performance fix (bulk cache + parallel LLM offload).
Verifies:
- POST /api/i18n/auto-translate batch works and returns actual French translations
- Immediate re-request is fast (cache-hit path)
- Brand protection preserves 'RealAICoach' inside French sentences
- Event-loop responsiveness: /api/health <2s during large in-flight translate batch
