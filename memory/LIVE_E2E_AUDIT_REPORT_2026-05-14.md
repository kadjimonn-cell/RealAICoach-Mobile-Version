## PASS/FAIL Audit Matrix

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `/api/health` availability | PASS |
| `/api/features/registry` total exactly 24 | PASS |
| Expected 24 feature IDs present | PASS |
| 24 feature frontend routes return 200 | PASS |
| Side-nav features present (`games-station`, `travel-visa`, `ai-learning-hub`) | PASS |
| Free entitlement (`ai_conversations_daily=3`) | PASS |
| Basic entitlement (`ai_conversations_daily=10`) | PASS |
| Premium entitlement (`ai_conversations_daily=-1`, unlimited) | PASS |
| Free blocked on premium routes | PASS |
| Basic blocked on premium routes | PASS |
| Non-admin blocked on admin routes | PASS |
| Admin allowed on admin routes | PASS |
| `GET /api/admin/features/registry/all` compatibility endpoint | PASS (fixed) |

## Root Cause(s) Found During Live Run

1. **Preview/API instability (502) during live validation**
   - Root cause: stale `EXPECTED_PREVIEW_HOST` in `/app/frontend/.env`.
   - Evidence: backend startup guard error in `/var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log`.
   - Permanent fix applied: updated host to current preview domain and restarted supervisor services.

2. **Minor admin endpoint consistency gap**
   - Symptom: testing flagged `/api/admin/features/registry/all` behavior inconsistency.
   - Root cause: only `/api/features/registry/all` route existed.
   - Permanent fix applied: added admin alias endpoint `GET /api/admin/features/registry/all` in `backend/routes/feature_registry.py` with admin guard.

## Permanent Fixes Applied

- Updated: `/app/frontend/.env`
  - `EXPECTED_PREVIEW_HOST=theme-compliance-hub-1.preview.emergentagent.com`
- Updated: `/app/backend/routes/feature_registry.py`
  - Added shared payload helper for all-features admin response
  - Added compatibility alias route: `/admin/features/registry/all`
- Verified via:
  - direct curl/API checks
  - pytest suite (`32 passed`)
  - testing agent report

## Artifacts

- Testing agent report: `/app/test_reports/iteration_1.json`
- Backend E2E tests: `/app/backend/tests/test_live_e2e_features.py`
- Precheck artifact: `/app/memory/live_e2e_precheck_report.json`
- Final audit data (machine-readable): `/app/memory/live_e2e_audit_data.json`
- Screenshot evidence: `/root/.emergent/automation_output/20260514_133700/final_20260514_133700.jpeg`
- Console trace: `/root/.emergent/automation_output/20260514_133700/console_20260514_133700.log`

## Notes

- The 24-feature user-facing registry is healthy and consistent with side navigation.
- Subscription access control is enforced by centralized middleware + access-control engine.
- No **critical** backend/frontend defects remain from this scope.
