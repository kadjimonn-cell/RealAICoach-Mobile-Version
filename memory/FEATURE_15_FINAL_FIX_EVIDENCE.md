# Feature 15 Frontend Fix - Final Evidence Report

**Date**: 2026-05-30
**Session**: Fork Job - Global System Locked Protocol
**Protocol Status**: Checkpoints A, B, C COMPLETED

---

## 🎯 ISSUE SUMMARY

**Problem**: Feature 15 (Video Creator Studio) frontend crashed on mount, redirecting users to homepage instead of loading the Video Creator Studio interface.

**Root Cause**: Missing `hasAttemptedLoad` ref declaration AND improper auth hydration timing.

---

## ✅ CHECKPOINT C: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

### **Fix 1: Missing Ref Declaration**
**File**: `/app/frontend/app/features/ai-video.tsx`  
**Line**: 60  
**Change**: Added missing `hasAttemptedLoad` ref

```typescript
// BEFORE (Line 59-61):
const accent = '#14B8A6';
const mountedRef = useRef(true);
// ❌ hasAttemptedLoad was referenced but never declared

// AFTER (Line 59-61):
const accent = '#14B8A6';
const mountedRef = useRef(true);
const hasAttemptedLoad = useRef(false);  // ✅ ADDED
```

---

### **Fix 2: Auth Hydration Timing**
**File**: `/app/frontend/app/features/ai-video.tsx`  
**Lines**: 26-28, 140-165

**Change 1**: Extract `isLoading` from `useAuth` hook
```typescript
// BEFORE:
const { user } = useAuth();

// AFTER:
const { user, isLoading: authLoading } = useAuth();  // ✅ Added isLoading
```

**Change 2**: Update useEffect to wait for auth to finish loading
```typescript
// BEFORE (Lines 140-165):
useEffect(() => {
  mountedRef.current = true;
  if (hasAttemptedLoad.current) return;
  
  const initTimer = setTimeout(() => {
    if (mountedRef.current && !hasAttemptedLoad.current) {
      hasAttemptedLoad.current = true;
      loadBootstrapData();
    }
  }, 250);  // ❌ Timeout-based approach - unreliable
  
  return () => {
    clearTimeout(initTimer);
    mountedRef.current = false;
  };
}, []);  // ❌ Empty deps - doesn't react to auth changes

// AFTER (Lines 140-165):
useEffect(() => {
  mountedRef.current = true;
  console.log('[VideoStudio] Component mounted, auth loading:', authLoading);
  
  // ✅ Wait for auth to finish loading
  if (authLoading) {
    console.log('[VideoStudio] Auth still loading, waiting...');
    return;
  }
  
  // ✅ Don't attempt if already tried
  if (hasAttemptedLoad.current) {
    console.log('[VideoStudio] Already attempted load, skipping');
    return;
  }
  
  // ✅ Auth is ready, proceed with bootstrap
  console.log('[VideoStudio] Auth ready, user:', user ? 'authenticated' : 'unauthenticated');
  hasAttemptedLoad.current = true;
  loadBootstrapData();
  
  return () => {
    console.log('[VideoStudio] Component unmounting, cleaning up...');
    mountedRef.current = false;
  };
}, [authLoading, user]);  // ✅ Re-run when auth state changes
```

## 📊 IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Code Fix 1** | ✅ COMPLETE | Added missing `hasAttemptedLoad` ref declaration |
| **Code Fix 2** | ✅ COMPLETE | Added `isLoading` extraction from useAuth |
| **Code Fix 3** | ✅ COMPLETE | Rewrote useEffect to wait for auth completion |
| **Frontend Build** | ✅ COMPLETE | New bundle: `index-c81cc653012a08c3a79af964d1019cc5.js` |
| **Production Deployment** | ✅ COMPLETE | expo_manual restarted, serving new build |

## 🔍 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

### **Why the Original Code Failed**

1. **Missing Variable Declaration**:
   - Code referenced `hasAttemptedLoad.current` on lines 146, 147, 153, 154
   - Variable was never declared with `useRef`
   - JavaScript threw error or evaluated to undefined
   - Component crash → Error boundary → Redirect to homepage

2. **Auth Race Condition**:
   - Component mounted and immediately called bootstrap API after 250ms timeout
   - Auth context (`useAuth`) was still in "loading" state
   - API call fired with no auth token → 401 Unauthorized
   - Component crashed due to auth failure

3. **Poor State Dependency Management**:
   - `useEffect` had empty dependency array `[]`
   - Didn't react to auth state changes
   - Used arbitrary timeout instead of listening to auth completion

### **How the Fix Resolves It**

1. **Variable Declaration**:
   - Added `const hasAttemptedLoad = useRef(false);`
   - Prevents undefined variable errors
   - Ensures proper duplicate-load prevention logic

2. **Auth-Aware Loading**:
   - Extract `isLoading` from `useAuth()` hook
   - Check `if (authLoading) return;` before making API calls
   - Wait for auth to complete before attempting bootstrap

3. **Reactive Dependencies**:
   - Changed deps from `[]` to `[authLoading, user]`
   - useEffect re-runs when auth state changes
   - Properly responds to auth completion

## 🧪 VALIDATION STATUS

| Test Method | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| **Code Compilation** | ✅ PASS | No TypeScript/linting errors |
| **Frontend Build** | ✅ PASS | Expo export completed successfully (283s) |
| **Service Deployment** | ✅ PASS | expo_manual restarted and running (PID 10465) |
| **Page Load** | ✅ PASS | curl confirms HTML is being served |
| **Screenshot Test** | ⚠️ BLOCKED | Cloudflare security challenge blocking automated testing |

**Note on Screenshot Test**: Playwright encountered Cloudflare bot protection. This is expected behavior for production sites. Manual browser testing required for final validation.

---

## 📋 CHECKPOINT D: USER VALIDATION REQUIRED

**Implementation Complete**: ✅ All code fixes applied and deployed

**Remaining Step**: User must manually verify Feature 15 in browser:

### **Manual Validation Checklist**:
1. Navigate to: `https://admin-policy-hub.preview.emergentagent.com/features/ai-video`
2. Verify page loads without redirecting to homepage
3. Verify "Video Creator Studio" heading is visible
4. Verify tabs are visible (Video Creator Studio, Scan, AI Chat)
5. Verify bootstrap data loads (no infinite "Loading studio..." state)
6. Verify no console errors related to `hasAttemptedLoad` or auth timing

**Expected Console Logs** (after fix):
```
[VideoStudio] Component mounted, auth loading: true
[VideoStudio] Auth still loading, waiting...
[VideoStudio] Component mounted, auth loading: false
[VideoStudio] Auth ready, user: authenticated
[VideoStudio] Loading bootstrap data...
[VideoStudio] Bootstrap response received
[VideoStudio] Bootstrap data loaded successfully
```
