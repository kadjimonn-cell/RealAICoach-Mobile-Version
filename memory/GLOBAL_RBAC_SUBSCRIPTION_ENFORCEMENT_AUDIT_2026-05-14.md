# Global RBAC + Subscription Enforcement Audit (RealAICoach)

Date: 2026-05-14  
Environment: `https://admin-policy-hub.preview.emergentagent.com`

## Scope Implemented
1. Remove Basic/Premium access for all existing non-admin real users.
2. Enforce Team Management as Admin-only.
3. Enforce pay-first access (verified payment required for paid entitlements).
4. Add enterprise controls (dual-admin high-risk approval, break-glass support, tamper-evident ledger, policy gate tests, quarterly recertification scheduler).

## PASS/FAIL Matrix

| Control | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Non-admin paid baseline reset | PASS | `global_rbac_subscription_enforcement_runs_last5.json` run `manual_global_enf_07ed4c12282c` |
| Team Management admin-only | PASS | `/api/admin/employees` = 403 for non-admin, 200 for admin (`post_enforcement_access_verification.json`) |
| Admin route decision reason for non-admin | PASS | `/api/access-control/check-route` reason=`admin_required` |
| Paywall for free users on premium routes | PASS | `iteration_4.json`, `post_enforcement_access_verification.json` |
| High-risk RBAC dual approval required | PASS | `/api/admin/employees/bulk-update-role` returns 428 without token |
| Break-glass endpoints present/admin-only | PASS | `iteration_4.json` (`break_glass_support`) |
| Tamper-evident governance artifacts populated | PASS | `enterprise_access_ledger`, `global_rbac_subscription_enforcement_runs` |
| 24-feature platform stability preserved | PASS | `/api/features/registry` total=24 |

## Data Evidence (Platform)

From enforcement run `manual_global_enf_07ed4c12282c`:
- Pre: `non_admin_basic=35`, `non_admin_premium=25`, `non_admin_paid_unverified=47`, `non_admin_subscription_permanent=1`, `non_admin_premium_access=1`
- Mutation: `baseline_downgraded_non_admin_paid=60`, `revoked_non_admin_privilege_flags=3`, `sessions_revoked_for_impacted_users=60`
- Post: `non_admin_basic=0`, `non_admin_premium=0`, `non_admin_full_access=0`, `non_admin_subscription_permanent=0`, `non_admin_premium_access=0`

## Code-Level Controls Applied

### RBAC + Subscription Core
- `backend/utils/access_control_engine.py`
  - Removed non-admin privilege bypass behavior (`platform_role`, `full_access`, `subscription_permanent`).
  - Added strict admin-only denial for `/api/admin/employees*`, `/api/admin/access-control*`, `/api/team-management*`.
  - Enforced paid entitlement requirement: paid plan needs `payment_verified=True`.

- `backend/routes/subscription_enforcement.py`
  - Standardized non-admin admin-route denial response (`admin_required`).

### Team Management Admin-only
- `backend/routes/platform_employees.py`
  - Team management route access helper now requires `require_admin`.
  - Added dual-admin requirement on high-risk mutations.
  - Added tamper-evident access ledger writes for audit events.

### Enterprise Governance
- `backend/utils/access_governance.py` (new)
  - Dual-admin approval request/consume flow.
  - Break-glass active session bypass support.
  - Tamper-evident enterprise access ledger.
  - Global RBAC/subscription enforcement routine with run artifacts.

- `backend/routes/access_control.py`
  - Added admin endpoints:
    - approvals list/approve/reject
    - break-glass activate/deactivate/status
    - global enforcement trigger endpoint
  - Hardened admin-only access on governance routes.

### Scheduler (continuous controls)
- `backend/scheduler_jobs.py`
  - `scheduled_global_rbac_subscription_enforcement` (hourly)
  - `scheduled_quarterly_access_recertification` (quarterly)

- `backend/scheduler.py`
  - Registered above jobs.

### Frontend Guardrails
- `frontend/src/context/AccessControlContext.tsx`
  - Hard block non-admin access for team-management/policy-admin routes.

- `frontend/src/components/AppShell.tsx`
  - Admin nav rendering restricted to admin only.

- `frontend/app/team-management.tsx`
  - Page access capabilities now admin-only.

## Tests Executed

- Testing Agent: `/app/test_reports/iteration_4.json` (PASS)
- Backend suites:
  - `/app/backend/tests/test_global_rbac_subscription_enforcement.py` (36 passed)
  - `/app/backend/tests/test_live_e2e_features.py` (32 passed, policy-aligned)
  - `/app/backend/tests/test_enterprise_access_policy_gate.py` (4 passed)
  - Combined local run: **72 passed**
- Deep testing backend agent: PASS (20/20 critical checks)

## Artifacts

- `/app/memory/global_rbac_subscription_enforcement_runs_last5.json`
- `/app/memory/global_rbac_subscription_enforcement_run_latest.json`
- `/app/memory/post_enforcement_access_verification.json`
- `/app/memory/dual_admin_approval_verification.json`
- `/app/test_reports/iteration_4.json`
- Screenshot smoke: `/root/.emergent/automation_output/20260514_155102/final_20260514_155102.jpeg`

## Notes

- Sensitive admin mutations may be additionally blocked by existing platform Production Security Policy Gate when prerequisites fail. This is a separate defense layer and remained active during validation.
- **MOCKED APIs: NONE**
