# Strict Deep Audit Rerun — Production Live Validation

Date: 2026-05-14  
Preview URL tested: `https://visa-polish-v2.preview.emergentagent.com`

## Final Verdict
- **Overall: PASS**
- Backend: **32/32 passed** (pytest)
- Frontend/Backend deep audit rerun: **PASS**
- Feature registry parity: **24/24 live user-facing features verified**
- Subscription access controls: **PASS** for Free/Basic/Premium/Admin

## PASS/FAIL Matrix

| Area | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Core frontend availability (`/`, `/welcome`, `/features`, `/login`) | PASS | `/app/test_reports/iteration_3.json` |
| Registry total exactly 24 | PASS | `/api/features/registry` checks in `iteration_3.json` |
| 24 feature IDs present | PASS | `iteration_3.json > verified_features.feature_registry` |
| Feature routes and representative functionality checks | PASS | `iteration_3.json > pass_fail_matrix` |
| Access-control session + route decisions | PASS | `iteration_3.json > subscription_access_control` |
| Free plan limited access | PASS (`ai_conversations_daily=3`) | `iteration_3.json` |
| Basic plan expanded access | PASS (`ai_conversations_daily=10`) | `iteration_3.json` |
| Premium plan unlimited access | PASS (`ai_conversations_daily=-1`) | `iteration_3.json` |
| Non-admin blocked from admin endpoints | PASS | `iteration_3.json` |
| Admin allowed on admin endpoints | PASS | `iteration_3.json` |
| Admin alias endpoint `/api/admin/features/registry/all` | PASS | `iteration_3.json` |

## Root Cause Findings During Rerun

1. **Intermittent homepage null-map crash risk**
   - Finding source: `WelcomeSocial` card slicing could include undefined entries in edge timing windows.
   - Fix applied: defensive null filtering in displayed activity list.
   - File: `/app/frontend/src/components/welcome/WelcomeSocial.tsx`

2. **Stale preview-host API call risk in welcome tickertape**
   - Finding source: tickertape API base used static env expression and could drift to stale preview host in runtime edge conditions.
   - Fix applied: moved to runtime-safe base resolver (`resolveRuntimeBaseUrl()`).
   - File: `/app/frontend/src/components/welcome/WelcomeLiveTickertape.tsx`

3. **Frontend availability risk when dist artifacts are partially missing (ENOSPC scenario)**
   - Finding source: `serve-production.js` startup path could block on static export attempts when dist/server artifacts were incomplete, causing transient 502/404.
   - Fix applied:
     - Hardened dist artifact validation (`hasDistArtifacts`) to require real server/client artifacts.
     - Added deterministic fallback to Expo dev proxy when dist is missing unless forced rebuild is explicitly enabled.
   - File: `/app/frontend/serve-production.js`

## Permanent Fixes Applied in This Rerun

- `/app/frontend/src/components/welcome/WelcomeSocial.tsx`
  - Added null-safe filtering for rendered activity cards.
- `/app/frontend/src/components/welcome/WelcomeLiveTickertape.tsx`
  - Replaced static env API base with `resolveRuntimeBaseUrl()`.
- `/app/frontend/serve-production.js`
  - Strengthened `hasDistArtifacts()` checks.
  - Added safe no-block fallback when dist artifacts are missing and rebuild is not forced.
